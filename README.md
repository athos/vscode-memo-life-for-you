### Memo: New

### Memo: Today's quick Memo

* Open the `YY-MM-DD.md` file if it exists. If it does not exist, create it and open.
* Every time you open, add a timestamp on the bottom line. example: `## 2017-10-19 Thu 06:38`
* You can insert ISOweek and random-Emoji into the timestamp. example: `## [Week: 42/52] üò∏ 42 2017-10-19 Thu 06:26`

### Memo: Edit

* Open by selecting a file and move the cursor to the corresponding line
