> **For windows:** From the memo command, I do not know how to write the path to execute ripgrep that is included in VS Code. Therefore, it is necessary to set the grep command individually in Windows environment.
(ripgrep command path: `c:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\resources\app\node_modules\vscode-ripgrep\bin\rg`)

### About the memo command

## tips

### Transpare quickitem list

![alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satokaz/vscode-memo-life-for-you/assets/images/vscode-memo_transparentize_menu.png)

You can transparentize the quickitem list which displays the file list and search results.
However, this setting also affects the sidebar.

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "sideBar.background": "#262626DD" // For a Dark theme 
    // "sideBar.background": "#F0F0F0DD"  //For a light theme
},
```
